# Getting Cleaning Data

This is part of the assignment from week 4 in the "Getting Cleaning Data" Course. 
Within this Github project, I have uploaded 4 new files: 

1. README.md this file itself
2. CodeBook.md a file explain the variables and other information in the tyde dataset
3. run_analysis.R a file containing the R script for analysis as required
4. tidy.txt a text file containing the data set that I cleaned up from the orginal source file

In addition, the source data set has also been uploaded within folder UCI_HAR_Dataset for convenience.
